Dragging an axis from a gizmo
=============================

You can easily drag an axis from a gizmo by **double clicking** on it, which enters a magnetic state that follows your mouse cursor until you **click again**.
You can also drag by **holding** the **left mouse button**, moving the mouse and then **releasing**.

When dragging you can directly enter a value to offset the plane or just type **=** to do so.
The units used are those specified in your scene settings.
You can type and mix any units supported by Blender and write calculations.
Those will be automatically calculated and produce a result value.

Once you have dragged an axis to the offset you want, you can still change the side of alignment, making **left click** over the appropriate arrows of the axis gizmo. You can also do this from the Sidebar (**N**), using the **Alignment depth** buttons.
