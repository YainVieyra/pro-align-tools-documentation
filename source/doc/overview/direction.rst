Selecting the Direction of projection
=====================================

The Direction of projection is related to the translation of objects.

You can change the **current axis** for Direction interactively in the 3D view by using the shortcuts **X**, **Y**, **Z**.

The built-in orientations of **Pro Align Tools** for direction includes:

* **Global:** Translate objects in the axes of the world coordinates
* **Local:** Translate objects in the axes of the selected objects
* **View:** Translate objects in the axes of the current viewport space
* **Perpendicular:** Always translate objects perpendicularly towards the projection Plane (no axis used)
* **Custom:** Translate objects in the axes of any **Custom transform orientation** defined by the user

Some orientations for Direction can also be changed directly in the 3D view by using the appropriate shortcuts:

* **L:** Switch between **Local** and **Global** orientations
* **V:** Switch between the current **View** and **Global** orientations
* **P:** Switch between the **Perpendicular** and **Global** orientations

When you use the **Local** direction, you can choose between 2 different behaviours:

* Use the local direction of the **active** object for all selected objects: All directions are the same.
* Use the local direction of every object **individually**: The directions are independent for every object.
