Setting the *Direction* of projection
=====================================

Similarly to how the *projection Plane* makes use of the axes of orientations, the *Direction* of projection can take an axis for the translation of objects.

You can change the current axis for *Direction* interactively in the 3D view by using the shortcuts **X**, **Y**, **Z**.

The built-in orientations of **Align Tool** includes:

* **Global:** Axes of the world coordinates
* **Local:** Axes of the selected object
* **View:** Axes of the current viewport space
* **Perpendicular:** Always perpendicular to the *projection Plane* (no axes)
* Custom: Axes of any **Custom orientation** defined for the Scene

The *Direction* of projection can also be changed directly in the 3D view by using the appropriate shortcuts.

* **L:** Switch between **Local** and **Global** directions
* **V:** Switch between the current **View** and **Global** directions
* **P:** Switch between the **Perpendicular** to *Plane* and **Global** directions


When you use the **Local** direction, you can choose between 2 different criteria:

* Use the local direction of the active object for all selected objects: All directions are the same.
* Use the local direction of every object individually: The directions can be different for every object.
