Local Space
===========

To select the Origin point in local space, hold both the **Ctrl** and **Alt** keys simultaneously.

If you have objects selected, you can see the rounded points in the corners of the Active objectâ€™s local bound box, and also the square ones in the midpoints of the box.
They are colored in **pink/magenta**.

You can select any of the points in the bound box with **left click** while in this mode.

This action will also enable the use of the **Local bounds** button in the Sidebar (**N**), from where you can also switch between global/local space.
