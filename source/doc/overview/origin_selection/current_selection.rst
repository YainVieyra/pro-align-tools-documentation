Picking the *Origin point* from the current selection
=====================================================

When you have more than one object selected at a time, pressing **Ctrl** will also show the selectable points of an additional bounding box surrounding the objects.

This points appear dark colored, and are different than the white points surrounding individual objects, as they will treat the selection as a group, moving all objects the same amount and in the same direction.

You can notice that all selected objects highlight when you pass near some of the dark points.
If you click with the **Left mouse button** on some of this points, the button **All selected** is enabled in the Origin point panel, meaning that all the selected objects will move as a whole.

If you combine this mode with the **Preset Alignment** buttons, you can easily align all objects to the *projection Plane* without losing the distances between them.
