Picking the *projection Plane* from another object
==================================================

If you need to pick a projection Plane from an object outside the selection, you can do it from the dropdown list of objects of the Plane panel.

.. figure:: /images/2.79/plane_dropdown.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 40%
   
   Select a target object from the dropdown.


You can also do this easily in the 3D view when you are in interactive mode, by using the shortcut **Shift** + **Left mouse click** over an object.
You will have to ensure that you are not pointing to a pickable *Plane*, otherwise, you will be selecting a new *projection Plane* instead of an object as target.

   First, point to an object while you hold the Shift key.

   :align: center
   
   Then, click with the left mouse button.
   The object is set as the projection Plane.
   As you can notice, it's still outside the selection.
   This allows to move all other objects except this one.


If you want to clear the current object set as target for *projection Plane*, just do **Shift** + **Left mouse click** in an empty space, far from any object or pickable *Plane*. Or just click in the **X** button next to the Object name in the Plane panel.
