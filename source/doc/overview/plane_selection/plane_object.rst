Selecting a Plane from an object outside of selection
=====================================================

If you need to select a Plane from an object outside your current selection, you can do this by selecting it in the **Plane Object** dropdown list of the **Plane** panel or by using the eyedropper in the name field to select the object directly from the 3D View.

   Selecting a target object from the dropdown list.

To clear the selected Plane Object, just click the **X** button next to the Object name.

Setting the Plane Object allows you to use its **location** and **bound box** as **Plane targets**, so when you are in Plane selection mode pressing **Shift** and/or **Alt**, their elements are drawn and you can set an alignment Plane from them.

This way you have freedom to manipulate your selected objects while the Plane Object remains untouched.
