Picking the *projection Plane* from the current selection
=========================================================

When you have more than one object selected at a time, pressing **Shift** will also show the selectable *projection Planes* of an additional bounding box surrounding the objects.

The points of this bounding box will appear dark colored, to differentiate from points of individual objects.

You can notice that all selected objects highlight when you pass near some of the dark points.
If you click with the **Left mouse button** on some of this points, the User Interface in the Plane panel will reflect this change enabling the use of bounds for the **Selected** objects.
