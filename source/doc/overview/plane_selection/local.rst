Local Space
===========

To select the Plane in local space, hold both the **Shift** and **Alt** keys simultaneously.

If you have objects selected, you can see the rounded points in the corners of the local bounding boxes.
They are colored in **pink/magenta** when referring to the **Active** object and **black** when referring to your current **Selection** of objects.

The bound box surrounding your Selection of objects is generated according to the local space of your Active object.
If you select another object as Active you get a different bound box surrounding all objects.

You can select any of the axes in the bound box with **left click** while in this mode.

This action will also enable the use of the **Local bounds** button in the Sidebar (**N**), from where you can also switch between global/local space.

If the bound box is being drawn in the 3D view, it is shown colored with the current axis Plane in use.
