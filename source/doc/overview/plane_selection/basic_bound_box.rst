Selecting a Plane from the basic bound box
==========================================

You can use a more basic approximation to the object's geometry by using a **global** bound box that surrounds the **local** bounds of the object.
This bound box ignores the object's geometry, which usually means that the projection Plane will not always exactly touch the objectâ€™s surface.

To use this bound box, use the shortcut **Shift** + **G** or by disabling the **Use geometry** button in the **Plane** panel from the Sidebar (**N**), when the plane **Target** is set to use the **Object Bounds**.

Both **global** and **local** bound boxes are drawn simultaneously in this mode.
