Scrolling the current orientation in Plane selection mode
=========================================================

When you are in Plane selection mode, holding the **Shift** and **Alt** keys, you can also see the legend with the word ‘Plane’, and below, the current **plane orientation** in use, colored in **pink/magenta**, which you can change by **scrolling** your mouse **wheel up/down**.
The plane orientation can also be set from the **Plane** panel in the Sidebar (**N**), below the Plane **Target**.

The **plane orientations** are only used for some key points such as the origin of the **world**, the **cursor** and the **location** of the Active object.

You may use any of the predetermined orientations such as: **Global**, **Local** and **View**. Select the **Custom** orientation option to use your own orientations.
