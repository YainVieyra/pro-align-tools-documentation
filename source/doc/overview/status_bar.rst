Status bar
==========

The Status bar provides information about the **current state** of **Pro Align Tools**.
It is updated whenever you change something relevant, whether by clicking some button in the Sidebar or by using the shortcuts.

The Status bar informs about the three main concepts of an alignment: **Direction**, **Plane** and **Origin**.

The Status bar replaces the default shortcuts bar of Blender 2.8x.
It is always visible until you get out of the Align tool in both Object and Edit modes.
