Auto-Alignment mode
===================

The predetermined mode of operation of **Pro Align Tools** is Auto-Alignment.
This mode is a combination of settings, allowing to choose very fast an **Origin Point**, a **projection Plane**, a **Direction** of alignment, and the use of **local/global space**.

Auto-Alignment mode make use of some special gizmos which are a combination of 3 axes (X, Y, Z), each one providing up to 3 depths of alignment.
In total, a single gizmo offers 9 unique alignments.
When combined with a bound box, you are allowed to use up to 27 different alignments within the box.

The Auto-Alignment gizmos are also available for some special points like the origin of the world and the cursor.
