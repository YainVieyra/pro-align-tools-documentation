Current Orientation
===================

When you hold the **Alt** key, a legend appears with the text ‘Auto-Align’. Below, the current **plane orientation** appears, colored in **pink/magenta**, which you can change by **scrolling** your mouse **wheel up/down** when holding **Alt**.

   :align: center
   
   Use the cursor rotation by selecting the LOCAL orientation.

The **plane orientations** for Auto-Align only apply to the origin of the **world** and **cursor** points, as objects on the other hand, can only use the global and local **bounding boxes**.
